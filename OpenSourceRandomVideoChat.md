# Introduction #

Open Source version of the RVC random video chat software, built with Adobe Flash Builder (Flex) and based on Adobe Cirrus/AFMS or Red5. The initial project is based on RVC v4.0, the software that powered Govido for over five months and brought the popularity to this website.

Future: we will further develop RVC Open Source and kindly ask you to join us with posting your ideas and contribution in order to create a better random video chat that is available to everyone, for free:

RVC includes audio, video and text data streaming over both Cirrus – real time media flow protocol (RTMFP) by ©Adobe Labs – and the open source Red5 media server (RTMP), Wowza and AFMS is also possible. 2010′s highest rated random video chat software is finally open source, most chat roulette websites out there (even if they look very different) are powered by or built on RVC.
RVC is ready to run using the language of your choice, without the need of rewriting the software. In addition, RVC is probably the only script on the market, delivering the 100% open source code. Unlike most commercial scripts, with RVC you receive the unencodoed .PHP files, the editable language files, the configuration files AND the Flash sources to edit the .SWF application.
