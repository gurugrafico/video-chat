## Problems using SVN? ##
**Download the latest source package: http://code.google.com/p/video-chat/downloads/detail?name=RVC4.0.fxp**

**Explore changes and update your copy: http://code.google.com/p/video-chat/source/list**

for example, you download RVC 4.0 (**[r2](https://code.google.com/p/video-chat/source/detail?r=2)**) and the latest revision is (**[r5](https://code.google.com/p/video-chat/source/detail?r=5)**), click on (**[r5](https://code.google.com/p/video-chat/source/detail?r=5)**) and you see a **Log message** and **Affected files**. Expand the file details with **+** or by clicking on **diff**

_Make sure you are comparing (**[r2](https://code.google.com/p/video-chat/source/detail?r=2)**) to (**[r5](https://code.google.com/p/video-chat/source/detail?r=5)**) and NOT (**[r3](https://code.google.com/p/video-chat/source/detail?r=3)**) or (**[r4](https://code.google.com/p/video-chat/source/detail?r=4)**) to (**[r5](https://code.google.com/p/video-chat/source/detail?r=5)**), on the top middle you should see **[r2](https://code.google.com/p/video-chat/source/detail?r=2) vs. [r5](https://code.google.com/p/video-chat/source/detail?r=5)**. If you see something else click **Edit** (obviously, if you are comparing ([r3](https://code.google.com/p/video-chat/source/detail?r=3)) to ([r14](https://code.google.com/p/video-chat/source/detail?r=14)), the top middle should say ([r3](https://code.google.com/p/video-chat/source/detail?r=3)) vs. ([r14](https://code.google.com/p/video-chat/source/detail?r=14)))_
